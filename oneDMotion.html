<h2>One Dimensional Motion</h2>
<p> In this lesson will be learning about kinematics and applying it 
    in problems with one dimension of motion.
</p>
<h3>Intro to Kinematics</h3>
<h4>Vectors and Scalers</h4>
<p>
    Scalers and Vectors are both quantities used in motion problems. Scalers are much like the typical values you've 
    worked with before. For example, 5 is a value that just has a size also known as a magnitude, in this case a 
    magnitude is 5. However vectors have both a magnitude and a direction. We'll cover this in more detail in
    the proceeding sections.
</p>
<h4>Position</h4>
<p>
    Position is quite simply the location of an object. And is often denoted with 'S' If you are standing 5 meters from a block we cloud define 
    an axis with the blocks postion at 0 and your postion at 5. In higher dimensions the position will 
    have more components. If there is another block 2 ft away from the first block in the direction perpendicular 
    to the direction between you and the block. By the earlier grid, you could say that the first block is at 
    (0,0), the second block at (0,2), and your position is (5,0). 
</p>
<h4>Displacement</h4>
<p>
Displaceplacemet is the change in postion of an object, often denoted with &#8710;S, &#8710;x, &#8710;y, etc. 
Not to be confused with distance which is how much space an object has traveled during motion 
while displacement is the difference between the intital position and the final position.<br>
Displacement can be shown in the velocity by time graph as the area under the curve.
</p>
<h4>Velocity</h4>
<p>
    Before we can discuss velocity, I want to discuss speed. Speed is distance divided by time, which gives you 
    the rate of travel or the speed. For example, if you walk to a park a mile away in 20 minutes. Your speed 
    would be 1 mile per 20 minutes or, after some conversion, 3 miles per hour. <br>
    Velocity is similar to speed except velocity is a vector quantity representing rate of travel and direction. 
    For example, let's say the park from the speed example is north from your home and now you're walking back 
    home going south at the speed you were earlier. Your velocity would be 3mph south.<br>
    It's worth noting that if either the speed or direction of the velocity changes the velocity is not constant.<br>
    Velocity can be shown on a position by time graph as the slope of the curve. <br>
    The formula for average velocity is v<sub>ave</sub> = &#8710;S/&#8710;t
</p>
<h4>Acceleration</h4>
<p>
    Acceleration is vector quantity that represents the change in velocity over time, often denoted as 'a'. 
    It can be shown in the velocity by time graph as the slope of the curve. The formula for average aceleration 
    is a = &#8710;v/&#8710;t. 
</p>
<h3>Kinematic Formulas</h3>
<ul>
    <li>v=v<sub>0</sub>+at</li>
    <li>&#8710;S=&frac12;(v+v<sub>0</sub>)t</li>
    <li>&#8710;S=v<sub>0</sub>+&frac12;at<sup>2</sup></li>
    <li>&#8710;S=v-&frac12;at<sup>2</sup></li>
    <li>v<sup>2</sup>=v<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>+2a&#8710;S</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The Kinematic formulas are very helpful formulas for motion problems, they are comprised of initial velocity, 
    final velocity, time, acceleration, and displacement. One thing particularly interesting about these 
    equations. The first equation doesn't involve displacement, the second equation doesn't involve acceleration, 
    the third equation doesn't involve final velocity, the fourth equation doesn't involve inital velocity, 
    and the fifth equation doesn't involve time.<br>
    This is interesting because you're able to use these equations often in combination when solving problems and 
    often the information you have is a good hint for which kinematic equation you may need!<br>
    I'll be covering the Kinematic formulas more in the Two-Dimensional Motion lesson.
</p>
<h3>Horizontal Motion</h3>
<p>
    Horizontal motion is simply one dimensional motion moving horizontally or perpendicular to the force of 
    gravity.
    <span class = "emphasis">Example.</span> The driver of a car starts the car from the rest to a speed of 54.0 m/s. 
    The car achieved this speed in 20.0 s assuming the uniform acceleration of the car throughout, 
    find the distance covered in this time span.<br>
    First when approaching a problem, I like to draw a picture to facilitate reasoning.
</p>

<p>
    Looking at our kinematic formulas we can easily see the formula we should use for this problem is the second one. 
    As it requires intital velocity, final velocity, and time in order to calculate the change in position.<br>
    &#8710;S=&frac12;(v+v<sub>0</sub>)t<br>
    &#8710;S=&frac12;(54m/s+0m/s)20s<br>
    &#8710;S=&frac12;(54m/s)20s<br>
    &#8710;S=&frac12;(54m)20<br>
    &#8710;S=&frac12;1080m<br>
    &#8710;S=540m<br>

</p>
<h3>Free-Falling Objects</h3>
<p>
    Objects are considered to be in free fall when the only force acting upon them is the force of gravity. 
    In this section we will be learning to solve one dimensional motion problems involving objects that are 
    in free fall. When near the surface of the earth we use g for gravity which is equal to 9.8m/s<sup>2</sup> 
    which means in these problems the acceleration will be 9.8m/s<sup>2</sup> downwards.
    <span class = "emphasis">Example.</span> A person throws a ball directly upward with an initial velocity of 
    29.4 m/s, How many seconds will it take the ball to reach the highest position it will achieve? (Ignoring air resistance) <br>
    I'll first draw a picture.    
</p>
<img src="./Images/FreeFallExample.jpg" alt="Free Fall Example illustration">
<p>
    In the picture I've depicted the ball in the initial position when it's velocity is 29.4m/s directed upward. 
    as the ball travels it is subjected to the force of gravity and only the force of gravity and therefor is 
    considered to be in free fall and has an acceleration of 9.8m/s toward the earth, also known as g. Since the 
    velocity is directed upward but the acceleration is directed downwards the ball will decrease in velocity 
    at the rate of 9.8m/s. Eventually the velocity will reach 0m/s and at this point the object will be 
    instantaniously motionless before the acceleration due to gravity makes the velocity change direction and 
    the object falls downward. At this moment when velocity is 0m/s the object will be at it's highest position. <br>
    For this problem we will use the first kinematic equation, v=v<sub>0</sub>+at because we have the values for 
    v, v<sub>0</sub>, and a and we were asked for the time it would take to reach it's highest position.<br>
    v<sub>0</sub>+at=v<br>
    at=v-v<sub>0</sub><br>
    t=<sup>(v-v<sub>0</sub>)</sup>/<sub>a</sub><br>
    t=<sup>(0-29.4)</sup>/<sub>-9.8</sub><br>
    t=<sup>29.4</sup>/<sub>9.8</sub><br>
    t=3seconds
</p>
<h3>Comprehension question</h3>
<p>A person throws a ball directly upward with an initial velocity of 
    29.4 m/s, How many meters will the ball travel to reach the highest position it will achieve? (Ignoring air resistance)
