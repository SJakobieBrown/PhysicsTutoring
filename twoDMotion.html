<h2>Two Dimensional Motion</h2>
<p>
    In this lesson we'll be learning more about the kinematic formulas and how to derive them, how to add 
    subtract vectors to find a resulting vector, projectile motion problems, 
    and relative velocity. 
</p>
<h3>Deriving the Kinematic formulas</h3>
<ul>
    <li>v=v<sub>0</sub>+at</li>
    <li>&#8710;S=&frac12;(v+v<sub>0</sub>)t</li>
    <li>&#8710;S=v<sub>0</sub>+&frac12;at<sup>2</sup></li>
    <li>&#8710;S=v-&frac12;at<sup>2</sup></li>
    <li>v<sup>2</sup>=v<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>+2a&#8710;S</li>
</ul>
    <p>In this section I will be deriving some of the Kinematic formulas given above. 
    These equations are derived when acceleration is constant. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, 
    this means acceleration is the slope of the function v(t) and since acceleration is constant the function 
    would be linear.</p>
    
<div class = "emphasis">v=v<sub>0</sub>+at</div><br>
<div><img src="./Images/basicGraphExample.jpg" alt="Velocity/Time Graph"></div>
    <p>The image above shows a graph of Velocity by Time, Velocity is the vertical axis, time is the horizontal axis, 
    initial velocity is the Velocity intercept, and the slope is acceleration. The equation for a line is 
    y=mx+b where y is the vertical axis, m is the slope, x is the horizontal axis, and be is the y-intercept. 
    Simply substituting the variables with the variables from our graph gives us v=v<sub>0</sub>+at Which is
    the first kinematic formula.</p>
<div class="emphasis">&#8710;S=&frac12;(v+v<sub>0</sub>)t</div>
    Displacment is Velocity multiplied by time. Which can be represented on our graph as the area under the curve 
    of V(t).
<div><img src="./Images/Displacement0GraphExample.jpg" alt="Area Under Velocity over time graph"></div>
    Displacement is equal to the average velocity devided by time when acceleration is constant. In the kinematic 
    formulas acceleration is constant, which means that &#8710;S=&frac12;(v+v<sub>0</sub>)t Which is our second 
    kinematic formula!
<h3>Vector addition</h3>
<p>
    When adding two vectors together they are placed tip to tail and their addition sums to a resultant vector 
    where the beginning of the vector starts at the start of the first vector and ends at the end of the second 
    vector.
</p>
<div class = "emphasis">Example</div>
    First we have Vector A
<div><img src="./Images/VectorAGraphExample.jpg" alt="Unlabeled graph with a random vector named a"></div>
    Adding Vector B to Vector A
<div><img src="./Images/VectorABGraphExample.jpg" alt="Same unlabeled graph but with a random vector b added to a"></div>
    The addition of Vector B and Vector A is the resulting vector, drawn in red.
<div><img src="./Images/VectorRGraphExample.jpg" alt="Same unlabled graph with the resultant displayed in red added to it"></div>
<p>
    Finding the value of the resultant is as simple as adding the vertical and horizontal components of the vectors. 
    Using trigonmetry we know that sine = opposite/hypotenuse and cosine = adjacent/hypotenuse. This will be very important 
    for figuring out the vertical and horizontal component as the vertical component is the magnitude of the vector 
    multiplied by the sine of theta. Where theta equals the angle between the vector and the horizontal. The horizontal 
    component is the magnitude of the vector multiplied by the cosine of theta. Where theta is the angle between the vector 
    and the horizontal. V<sub>y</sub>=Vsin(&#1012;) and V<sub>x</sub>=Vcos(&#1012;) respectively.<br>
    The image below shows the vector A and b broken into components.
</p>
<img src="./Images/VectorComponentsGraphExample.jpg" alt="Components of Vectors A and B">
<table>
    <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>Vector A</th>
        <th>Vector B</th>
        <th>Resultant</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>x component</td>
        <td>Acos&#1012;</td>
        <td>Bcos&#981;</td>
        <td>Acos&#1012;+Bcos&#981;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>y component</td>
        <td>Asin&#1012;</td>
        <td>Bsin&#981;</td>
        <td>Asin&#1012;+Bsin&#981;</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>In this example, the y-components are both positive and add together. But the x-components are pointing in opposite 
directions, in order to determine the magnitude of the resultant's x-component, Vector A's x-component will be negative.
This is demonstrated in the image below.</p>
<img src="./Images/VectorRComponentsGraphExample.jpg" alt="Components of Resultant Vector">
<p>
    To find the magnitude of the Resultant vector we simply have to apply the pathagorean theorem. a<sup>2</sup>+b<sup>2</sup>=c<sup>2</sup><br>
    R<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup>+R<sub>y</sub><sup>2</sup> = R<sup>2</sup><br>
    R = &#8730;(R<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup>+R<sub>y</sub><sup>2</sup>)<br>
    To find the angle from the horizontal, &#955;, we can use some trigonometry. We have the x and y components. 
    Tangent = Opposite/Adjacent, tan = y/x, therefor &#955; = arctan(R<sub>y</sub>/R<sub>x</sub>)
</p>
<h3>Projectile Motion</h3>
<p>
    Projectile motion problems refer to a type of problem where an object has been launched into the air, 
    usually at an angle. Using our knowledge of the Kinematic formulas and adding vectors, we can solve these 
    problems.
    </p>
    <div class="emphasis">Example</div>
    <p>
    A ball is kicked with a velocity of 18m/s at an angle of 38 degrees from the horizontal how many seconds pass 
    before the ball lands on the ground? (ignore air resistance)<br>
    As always, I like to draw a picture first.
</p>
<img src="./Images/projectileMotionExample.jpg" alt="Illustration of ball with trajectory">
<p>
    Finding the time of the projectile with just the velocity and the acceleration from gravity can be done 
    by using the kinematic formula v=v<sub>0</sub>+at and the y-component of the initial velocity. Since 
    we are ignoring friction we know the acceleration of the object is only the force of gravity and that 
    means the object will accelerate while moving downward at the same rate it decelerated while it was 
    moving upward. Since the object will travel the same distance both upwards and downwards, the final 
    velocity will be the opposite of the initial velocity. <br>
    -18sin(38)m/s = 18sin(38)m/s - 9.8m/s<sup>2</sup>t<br>
    (-36sin(38)m/s)/(-9.8m/s<sup>2</sup>) = t<br>
    t = 2.26s
</p>
<h3>Comprehension Question</h3>
<p>A ball is kicked with a velocity of 18m/s at an angle of 38 degrees from the horizontal how many meters does it travel 
    before it hits the ground? (ignore air resistance)<br>
