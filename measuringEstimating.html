<h2>Measuring & Estimating</h2>
<p> In physics, as well as other sciences, measuring isn't as straight 
    forward as it is in normal life. Every measurement we record is an estimation and the true value is subject to 
    uncertainty therefor when we measure we can only know the true value within a certain range. Also, we will 
    frequently use estimations rounded to a number of significant figures often expressed in scientific 
    notation. We will be covering all of this in lessons below. 
</p>
<h3>Uncertainty</h3>
<p> 
    When taking a measurement we use a measurement instrument to make an estimation of the true value. 
    The true value will be in the range of the estimation +/- uncertainty. 
    To find the uncertainty inherent in the measurement instrument we will take the smallest increment 
    measurable and divide it by two. <br>
    <span class="emphasis">Example:</span> The smallest increment a meter stick can measure is 1 millimeter. 
    Therefor the uncertainty of a measurement using a meter stick is 1mm/2. If you trace a 5 cm line using 
    the meter stick we can only the certain the length of the line will be within the range 5cm +/- .5mm.<br>
    However, the uncertainty for digital measurement instruments is just simply the smallest measurable 
    increment.
</p>
<h3>Significant Figures</h3>
<p> Significant figures are the digits in the number that show the precision of the value. .0220 has three 
    significant figures, 220, these are significant because they show how precise the value is. Let's say 
    that it's .0220km, that would be 220m, in this case that last zero shows us the precision of the value. 
    the measurement was taken in meters. <br>
    <span class="emphasis">Example:</span> With a meter stick we measure a square to find the area of the square 
    and we measure the square to be 0.0790m by 0.0590m. <br>
    7.90m &sdot; 5.90m = 46.61m<sup>2</sup> <br>
    Both of are multiplicands have 3 significant figures but it appears the product has 4 significant figures 
    and in this case it does. 7.90 and 5.90 have the trailing zeros it shows their precision is to the hundredths 
    and so even though the multiplicands have three significant figures the product has 4 because it is only as 
    precise as the initial values. If the initial values were 7.9 and 5.9 the product would have three significant 
    figures as 46.6.
</p>
<h3>Scientific Notation</h3>
<p> 
    Scientific notation is very useful for condensing extreme large or extremely tiny numbers. It uses the inherent 
    quality of the base 10 positional number system to easily expand for reduce numbers by powers of ten. 
    The number will be in the form x &sdot; 10<sup>n</sup> The rule of thumb is how many places you move the 
    decimal point to the left is the number by which you must increase the power, while how many decimal 
    places you move to the right is how many decimal points you need to decrease the power.<br>
    <span class="emphasis">Examples:</span> <br>
    59000 = 59 &sdot; 10<sup>3</sup> <br>
    .0002345 = 2.345 &sdot; 10<sup>-4</sup>
